    <p>People think we are color blind. This is not so. Canines can, in fact, see color; we have two cones in our eyes that detect yellow and blue. (It’s called dichromatic vision, those with thumbs can google it.) You humans have three cones, the third allowing you to distinguish red and green. Personally, the omission of Christmas colors doesn’t affect me greatly. I don’t care about the hue of the grass where I relieve myself; I don’t care if prosciutto loses its rosy luster, as long as it’s thinly sliced and there’s plenty of it. Like Shakespeare said, a rose by any other name is still as sweet. (That said, TBH I don’t love Shakespeare. Only one dog features in the entirety of his oeuvre and he’s a whelp named Crab in Two Gentlemen of Verona who doesn’t get much airtime and belongs to a servant rather than either of the titular gentlemen…but I digress.)</p>
