Its diverse geography includes the Western Ghats, which are rich in biodiversity and home to several wildlife sanctuaries.

        <h3>MYTH about its Origin</h3>
        <p>According to Hindu mythology, Kerala was created by Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is said that Parasurama threw his axe into the Arabian Sea from the top of the Western Ghats, and the sea receded to reveal a stretch of fertile land, which became Kerala. This legend gives Kerala the nickname "God's Own Country." Parasurama is also believed to have reclaimed the land to provide a place for Brahmins to live and practice their rituals, shaping Kerala's early religious and cultural landscape.</p>
